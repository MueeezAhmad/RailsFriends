# RailsFriends ðŸ‘¥

 A beginner Ruby on Rails application created as part of my learning journey to become a full-stack software developer.

##  About This Project

 **RailsFriends** is a simple Rails 8+ application that lets users sign up, log in, and manage their list of friends. This project helped me understand:

 - Devise authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out)
 - RESTful routes and CRUD operations
 - Rails MVC structure
 - Git and GitHub workflow
 - SSH setup on macOS
 - Deploy-ready Rails setup

##  Technologies Used

- Ruby on Rails 8+
- Ruby
- Devise gem for authentication
- PostgreSQL (or SQLite by default)
- Git & GitHub
